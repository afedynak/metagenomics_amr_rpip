## Respiratory Pathogen and AMR Identification

This repository contains scripts related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and microbial communities in freshwater lake samples from Ontario. The data includes a variety of measurements, such as gene abundances, sequence coverages, and variant analysis for different microorganisms and antimicrobial resistance genes across sites (Guelph Lake and Wilcox Lake). The plots generated by this script can help identify trends and differences in AMR gene distributions and microbial profiles across the study sites.
